# Protobom Community Respository

The protobom project community wants to ensure that all of our meetings, forums,
and chat channels are welcoming, inclusive spaces where contributors can share and
exchange their ideas freely to improve the state of the Software Bill of Materials
around the world.

## Governance

Our governance model is under development as we search for mechanisms to make
community and technical decisions at a quick enough pace that enables a healthy
innovation rhythm while considering the points of view of all interested
community members.

The current governance model is laid out in our [Technical Charter](CHARTER.md),
it reflects the way the original cohort of companies that created protobom voted
on decisions before the project moved to the OpenSSF.

## Code of Conduct

Interactions between the protobom community members and in all of the project's
forums are governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which is pretty
generic but can be summarized as: respect others, be kind and think about what is
best for the community as a group.

## Contributing to the Project

If you want to begin your journey as a technical contributor, check out our 
[Contributor Guide](https://github.com/protobom/protobom/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
in the main protobom repository. We also have many areas where the project needs
non-technical help!

Finally, we would love to know you! Consider joining our community meetings,
we will be happy to see you there.
